Interim Report
Purpose of the Interim Report



      • The Interim Report is a formal document that summarises the progress of your project to
        date.
      • It should be written and presented in a professional manner.
           • There are no strict formatting requirements, but there are document templates available
                under the “Resources” topic on Moodle.
      • The suggested length of the report is 5,000 words.
           • This is a suggested length only.
           • The report should be written in a clear and concise manner.
      • There are examples of good Interim Reports available on Moodle.
           • These are provided as a guide only.
           • Your report’s structure may vary depending on the nature of your project.



                                                                                                       3

Structure and Content (cont)



      • Progress.
           • A description of the completed work. Project management issues should also be discussed.
           • A review of the original project plan should be included along with an updated plan for the
             remainder of the project.
                 • A Gantt chart is a useful way to present this information.

      • Reflection.
           • Issues that have arisen and how they have been addressed.
           • What have you learned from completing the project so far?
      • Bibliography.
           • There is no strict format for the bibliography, but it should be consistent throughout the
             report.
                 • Ask your supervisor if they have a preferred format.



                                                                                                           5

In-class Exercise - Understanding the Requirements (10 Mins)



      Why are we doing this?

         • This is a good way to get a feel for the requirements of the Interim Report.
         • It is also a good way to get a feel for how your Interim Report will be marked.


      • Organise yourselves into groups of 2-4.
      • Open your laptops / tablet / phone.
      • One person should have the rubric open on their device.
      • Another person should have one example of a good Interim Report open on their device.
      • Go through and annotate where/when the report does/not meet a criterion specified in
        the rubric.


                                                                                                7
