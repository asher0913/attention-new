 Deliverable             An interim report consists of an outline with progress update and draft
                         content. A report structure example is provided in the lecture slides. Past
                         report examples are available on Moodle for reference.
 Format                      •   The document should consist of a single PDF file.
                             •   The word count for this assignment is limited to 5000 words, which is
                                 roughly equivalent to 15 A4 pages. Please note that the word limit
                                 does not apply to the cover page, references, or appendices.
                                 However, all other content within the document will contribute to the
                                 word count.
                             •   There is no prescribed template, format, or referencing style that
                                 must be followed for this assignment.
                             •   If you require guidance on these aspects, we recommend consulting
                                 your supervisor for advice.
