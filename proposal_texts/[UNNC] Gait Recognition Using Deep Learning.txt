      Aims and Objectives
      The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning based method in order
      to recognise people by their radar gait features. The objective method would be able
      to learn individuals’ gait features through several well processed radar time-frequency
      diagrams and recognise their identity by the learned model using deep learning. Apart
      from the main objective, the method is hopefully to be presented in a conference. The
      main objective could be divided into several sub-aspects to achieve:
        1. Study the micro-Doppler phenomenon and justify the possibility of applying it to
         recognise human gait.
        2. Process the raw radar signal for clear, recognisable and regular diagrams. The raw
         micro-Doppler radar signal is obtained in a 2D representation, which can be fairly
         noisy and hard for deep learning methods to extract and learn features. Thus, this
         step is to investigate the signal processing techniques to obtain suitable diagrams
         for learning.
        3. Explore and investigate possible deep learning methods existing in the industry to
         test and ﬁnd an eﬃcient way to classify and recognise gait features accurately.
        4. Design and develop a novel method by investigating diﬀerent radar signal represen-
         tations and applying them to obtain better performance in gait recognition.
        5. Compare and evaluate existing methods and the method I proposed.

      Background and Motivation
      Gait, an important biological characteristic of humans, can be measured at great dis-
      tances, and its recognition has become an attractive research area with many applications
      such as public safety monitoring [1], health screening [2] and human-computer interaction
      [3, 4].
      Superimposed sequences of images captured by optical sensors have been commonly used
      to represent walking people [5, 6]. However, this approach requires the images to be cap-
      tured from the side and depends heavily on the lighting conditions. The real photographs
      taken may also violate the privacy of individuals. Doppler radar can capture the micro-
      Doppler (mD) signatures of a moving target’s gait feature from the front [7], and it has
      been demonstrated that mD signals can reveal human dynamic features and ascertain
      human actions and gestures by some study [7, 8, 9]. More importantly, the radar signal
      is less invasive of privacy and works even in low-light conditions, making it robust in a
      variety of real-world situations [4]. Thus, in this project, I mainly focus on the recognition
      using mD signatures.
      The spectrogram is a time-varying representation of mD signatures in the joint time-
      frequency domain [7]. As the mD eﬀect induced by mechanical vibrating or rotating
      structures of a target is stable and constant, the Doppler frequency caused by that target
      could be well formulated by a function of dwell time [10]. Thus, the time-frequency
      spectrogram of mD signatures could be useful to represent a moving target and further
      be commonly used in gait recognition and classiﬁcation [9, 11, 12, 13, 14]. However, even
      the same person could have slightly diﬀerent gait cycles and diﬀerent start location of
      each cycle, which would lead to degradation in classiﬁcation performance. The repetition
      information of those frequencies is scarcely considered but is also the invariant feature of
      gait cycles.
      The Cadence Velocity Diagram (CVD) is another form of mD signatures converted from
      the spectrogram by taking Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along the time axis [15]. The
      CVDis less commonly used in the gait recognition [16, 17]. Althogh the transformation
      eliminates the temporal information of speed, the CVD provides another useful measure
      on the frequency of diﬀerent velocities of body parts repeat, which is complementary to
      the spectrogram.
      Diﬀerent kinds of traditional learning paradigms, such as naive Bayes [18], SVM [2] and
      KNN [19] have been used to classify mD signatures. However, their nature of relying
      on hand-crafted features makes them lose their edge in automatically learning informa-
      tive features compared to deep learning methods such as deep convolutional neural net-
      works. Several researchers have investigated deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)
      to implement the classiﬁcation of human gestures and human actions [20, 13]. [7] has
      developed temporal convolutional neural network for spectrogram, and [21] has utilised a
      dual-channel network to classify gait features. However, they did not exploit the latent
      of CVD, and their use of CNN ignored the unique physical nature of radar signal. Thus,
      the author will be trying to ﬁnd a suitable way to address the issues in this project.

      Project Plan
      The project is research oriented, so several research processes shall be strictly included.
      The ﬁrst step would be necessary literature review. Since radar signal is a new ﬁeld for
      me, relevant knowledge about diﬀerent representations of radar signal and the meaning of
      micro-Doppler is required to be learned. Then radar signal processing techniques would
      be necessary to master. After ﬁguring out how to process and represent radar signal in a
      proper form, feature extraction techniques are required to be studied. Since this project
      is closely linked to deep learning, this step would contain exploration in deep leaning
      methods related or unrelated to the gait recognition as some research may already ﬁnd
      ways to cope with radar gait features and some methods can be transferred to this area.
      After literature review, reproduction of some valuable existing ideas would be conducted
      to verify their availability, and new ideas might by raised in this stage by evaluating the
      existing ones. Experiments would be conducted to test some of the proposed ideas about
      the methods. According to the experimental results, there would be several sprints to
      evaluate and improve the proposed method. A proper deep learning based method for
      radar gait recognition would be proposed and evaluated at the end.
      The timeline of the project is illustrated in a Gantt chart shown below. The chart could
      automatically present the bar of a corresponding length by entering the start date and
      duration. The bars in diﬀerent colours denote diﬀerent status. Purple means complete
      status, and yellow refers to beyond the plan. Beginning from October 10 to April 4,
      there are 28 weeks in total, and the plan would have seven stages in total. The project is
      deliberately most arranged in the ﬁrst semester for submitting a conference paper.
