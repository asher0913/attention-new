        1 Background & Motivation
        Self-directed learning has been widely recognized for its essential role in fostering students’
        critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and intrinsic motivation, particularly in complex
        and abstract fields like computer science (CS). As one of the most high-potential disciplines,
        CS education has significantly benefited from integrating advanced educational technologies,
        such as large language models (LLMs) and gamification. However, a significant gap remains
        in promoting self-directed learning for certain challenging concepts in CS, especially in object-
        oriented programming (OOP), where abstract concepts can be difÏcult for students to grasp
        independently.
         Given these challenges, educational escape rooms (EERs) have emerged as an promising
        approachtoactivelearningandbreakouttraditionalclassroom, blendingproblem-solvingtasks
        with narratives to create immersive learning experiences [1]. EERs have been applied in many
        academicdisciplines, including computer science [2], physics [3], mathematics [4–8], biology [9],
        and chemistry [10]. Furthermore, as EERs are based on a game structure and design, they are
        linked to the methodology of gamification [1]. Students engage in subject-specific challenges
        within a structured, game-based environment. By requiring students to solve a series of puzzles
        to “escape”, EERs foster critical thinking and the application of knowledge in a stimulating,
        time-bound setting. However, traditional physical EERs’ are resource-intensive, restricted by
        classroom availability, budget, and a lack of time for preparation [11].
         To address these limitations, several researches turned to digital educational escape rooms
        (DEERs) to provide greater flexibility and immersion [12]: Baziak et al. developed a mathe-
        matical DEER integrating Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) technology [4]; Tsa-
        lidis et al. created Earscape, an auditory DEER using immersive virtual reality (IVR) [13];
        Guillen-Sanz et al. developed an IVR escape room for teaching physiological regulation [14].
        However, despite the growing interest in DEERs, few studies have explored the integration
        of head-mounted display (HMD) mixed reality (MR) technology, which offers unique advan-
        tages by seamlessly blending physical and virtual environments, allowing users to interact with
        digital objects within their physical surroundings [15].
         While the fusion of real and virtual elements has been proven to provide a more intuitive
        and immersive experience, enabling learners to connect abstract concepts with tangible inter-
        actions [15], there is limited exploration of MR-enhanced EERs in CS education. Therefore,
        it’s worth investigating the integration of MR to the development of educational escape room
        focused on CS education, especially in OOP concepts.
        2 Aims & Objectives
        Theproject aims to integrate MR technology into the development of a CS EER game, specifi-
        cally focusing on enhancing self-directed learning in OOP. By combining the immersive aspects
                               1
        of MR with the interactive nature of EERs, the project seeks to provide an innovative and
        engaging platform for students to grasp complex CS concepts, with the following objectives:
         1. To investigate the influence of immersive EER gameplay on students’ motivation, en-
           gagement, and self-directed learning within the context of CS education.
         2. Toexplorehowthecombinationofphysicalandvirtualelementsaffectsstudents’problem-
           solving and critical thinking abilities, particularly in applying OOP principles.
         3. To examine the effects of MR visualization on enhancing students’ understanding and
           retention of OOP concepts, by allowing them to interact with and manipulate virtual
           objects in a simulated EER environment.
        3 Project Plan
        The detailed timeline for this project is outlined in the Gantt chart below (see Fig.1). Given
        the research-oriented nature of the project, it begins with an extensive literature review on
        relevant topics, including CS education, EERs, and the integration of MR technology. This
        foundational phase will establish a comprehensive understanding of existing work in these
        areas.
          Followingtheliteraturereview, theprojectmovesintothedesignandimplementationofthe
        MREERgame, which represents the most time-intensive phase. This stage involves various
        tasks, including the creation and acquisition of art assets, programming, and the design of
        game mechanics that align with educational objectives. Due to the complexity of integrating
        MRand educational elements, this phase requires careful planning and coordination across
        multiple domains.
          Once the MR escape room game is fully implemented, a controlled experiment will be
        conducted to collect data on users’ learning outcomes, motivation, and engagement levels be-
        fore and after gameplay. The analysis of these results will form the basis for writing of a
        conference or journal paper, as this project is targeting academic publication. In the end, a
        comprehensive dissertation will be prepared, synthesizing the project’s findings, methodolo-
        gies, and contributions to the field.
